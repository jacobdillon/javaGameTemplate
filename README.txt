That Game by Those People
=========================

Hello!  This is the documentation for TGTP, which will detail how to run and
implement a map to use the TGTP engine on.

### Building & Running ###
To build TGTP, simply navigate to the src directory and run "javac Main.java".
This will build all of the class files, which you will then run with "java Main"
You must run TGTP from the src directory, or it will complain about not finding
the "game.jm" file.

### Configuring ####
To configure and create your own map for TGTP, edit the "game.jm" file under
resources.  This file is in a "key: value".
